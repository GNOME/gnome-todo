    <release date="2018-05-25" version="3.91.1">
      <description>
        <p>
          We're proud to annouce GNOME To Do 3.91.1!
        </p>
        <p>
          GNOME To Do 3.92.1 is the first alpha release of the next version, 4.0, and introduces a remarkable
          change in the main user experiece by switching to a sidebar-based layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new layout is more streamlined and suits better the needs of more advanced users, without letting
          go of the simplicity that was always a signature of GNOME To Do.
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives the flexibility needed for the introduction of new panels and plugins, which was simply
          not possible with the previous layout.
        </p>
        <p>This release also updates translations, and adds new translations.</p>

    <release date="2018-03-12" version="3.28.0">
      <description>
        <p>
          We're proud to annouce GNOME To Do 3.28.0!
        </p>
        <p>
          GNOME To Do 3.28 is a major improvement over the previous versions, and introduces
          exciting new features and important fixes. The highlights of this release are:
          <ul>
            <li>The Todoist integration was much polished and improved, and should work more reliably now.</li>
            <li>A big performance issue on startup was fixed. GNOME To Do should start much faster for users with many tasks.</li>
            <li>Google Tasks integration was fixed, and completed tasks now are correctly detected.</li>
            <li>Integration with Evolution received lots of improvements and fixes, and is reaching a mature state.</li>
            <li>Nightly Flatpaks have debugging and tracing enabled, allowing early testers to accurately report issues in To Do.</li>
            <li>A major rework of the task lists interface landed, bringing a much improved experience when managing your tasks!</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          One major drawback of this release is that the Todo.txt integration plugin lost the ability to handle subtasks. If you
          rely on that feature, please refrain from using this version of GNOME To Do.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to notice that Todoist and Todo.txt integrations are still considered experimental, and should not be
          used in production environments.
