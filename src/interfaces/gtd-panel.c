/**
 * SECTION:gtd-panel
 * @short_description: interface for panels
 * @title:GtdPanel
 * @stability:Unstable
 *
 * The #GtdPanel interface must be implemented by plugins that want
 * a given widget to be shown as a panel in the main window. Examples
 * of panels are the "Today" and "Scheduled" panels.
 *
 * A panel must have a unique name (see #GtdPanel:name) and a title.
 * The title can change dynamically. Avoid long titles.
 *
 * The panel may also provide header widgets, which will be placed
 * in the headerbar according to the #GtkWidget:halign property. See
 * gtd_panel_get_header_widgets() for a detailed explanation.
 *
 * The #GtdPanel:icon and #GtdPanel:priority properties are used by
 * the sidebar. The former is used to display the icon, and the latter
 * is used to determine the position of the panel relative to the
 * others panels.
 *
 * At last, a #GtdPanel implementation may provide a #GMenu that will
 * be appended to the window menu.
